                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>I have always been interested in many technologies including computers and videogames. Due to this I decided to pursue a career
                                in software development. In high school my career interests began in engineering. I was accepted into the University of Wisconsin-Madison's College of engineering
                                with a focus in Biomedical Engineering. During this program I took a Java programming class and after that I was hooked. I switched to a major in Computer Sciences
                                and graduated in May of 2020 with a B.S. Degree. </p>
