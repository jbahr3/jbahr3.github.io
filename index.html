    <p id='msg'>About me:</p>
        <p>
                I have always been interested in many technologies including computers and videogames. Due to this I decided to pursue a career
                in software development. In high school my career interests began in engineering. I was accepted into the University of Wisconsin-Madison's College of engineering
                with a focus in Biomedical Engineering. During this program I took a Java programming class and after that I was hooked. I switched to a major in Computer Sciences
                and graduated in May of 2020 with a B.S. Degree.

                I was born in Chicago, and spent summers at a cottage on a lake in Ontario, Canada. When I was 3, the family moved to a 
                suburb of Toronto, where we lived for 4 years, before returning to Evanston, IL, where I lived until graduating high school.
                Then I spent my 4 years in Madison, WI as I attended school. After graduation, I got a job as a Technology Development Trainee at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY,
                but because of Covid-19, worked remotely. During that time, I lived and worked from Evanston, Canada and Pittsburgh.
