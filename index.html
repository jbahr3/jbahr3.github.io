                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I have always been interested in many technologies including computers and videogames. Due to this I decided to pursue a career
                        in software development. In high school my career interests began in engineering. I was accepted into the University of Wisconsin-Madison's College of engineering
                        with a focus in Biomedical Engineering. During this program I took a Java programming class and after that I was hooked. I switched to a major in Computer Sciences
                        and graduated in May of 2020 with a B.S. Degree. </p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>I was born in Chicago, and spent summers at a cottage on a lake in Ontario, Canada. When I was 3, the family moved to a 
                            suburb of Toronto, where we lived for 4 years, before returning to Evanston, IL, where I lived until graduating high school.
                            Then I spent my 4 years in Madison, WI as I attended school. After graduation, I got a job as a Technology Development Trainee at M&T Bank in Buffalo NY,
                            but because of Covid-19, worked remotely. During that time, I lived and worked from Evanston, Canada and Pittsburgh. </p>
